# Socket-communication-with-GUI
Two way communication on python (socket programming) with a wonderful GUI (Tkinter Raspberry Pi 3 Model B)

This project is made for creating a chat window between two Raspberry Pi's. I've made a Tkinter window for chatting application.
Now :

First you've to run server files on one raspberry pi. It will show:

waiting for connection....

Then you've to run client files on another Raspberry Pi. It will ask the hostname (pi on which server is running)
Give the host name. Chat window will start.

Now next thing is to start the chat window on server raspberry pi.
Start the client file also on the raspberry pi which is running server. On starting it will ask Hostname (give the IP address of Pi on which the server itself is running)

Now you can see the Chat window. Start Chatting & Enjoy it.
